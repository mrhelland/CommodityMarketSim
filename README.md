# CommodityMarketSim

Current status of this project:
- Windows Forms
- .NET 4.72
- Database not implemented (teams and commodities are hardcoded)
- Generates HTML reports using a template

The scope of this project was significantly retracted since: 
- It was needed for an activity in my robotics class several days later
- I could only use spare time to work on it
The application is a functional windows forms application, but the algorithms and data management are in need of further work.

The ultimate goal is to port this to a SignalR ASP.net application. This will require some 
refactoring of the class libraries, so will probably end up as a separate project. 

If you have a similar project already started (or finished) that you are willing to share, 
I'd love to hear from you ;)
