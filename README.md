# CommodityMarketSim

Current status of this project:
- Stable
- Windows Forms
- .NET 4.72
- Database not implemented (teams and commodities are currently hardcoded arrays)
- Generates HTML purchasing reports (using a template) at market close

The scope of this project was significantly retracted since: 
- It was needed for an activity in my robotics class several days later
- I could only use spare time to work on it

The application is a functional windows forms application, but the algorithms and data management are in need of further work.

Originally, the ultimate goal was to port this to a SignalR ASP.net application. But running this as a single app with the whole class has produced an interesting dynamic that would be hard to duplicate if each team accessed the application directly.
