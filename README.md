# CommodityMarketSim

Current status of this project:
*Windows Forms
*.NET 4.72
*Database not implemented (teams and commodities are hardcoded)
*Generates HTML reports using a template

The scope of this project had to be seriously constrained since it was needed for an 
activity in my robotics class within 4 or 5 days. Using spare time the basic shell is
now fully functional, but the algorithms and data management are in need of further work.

The ultimate goal is to port this to a SignalR ASP.net application. This will require some 
refactoring of the class libraries, so will probably end up as a separate project. 

If you have a similar project already started (or finished) that you are willing to share, 
I'd love to hear from you ;)
